## Local Database creation
- You can create a new local database in MySQL.
- Run the script available on the top to create your data base.
- Then in MIMO/actions/database_connectivity.py change the initialization function to add the correct username and password.
- Then excecute the function add_doctor_info in MIMO/actions/database_connectivity.py to populate the doctor records and you are set.
- Note that you still will require the Password for the weather API from the connection file
